    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <p>
      At <strong>Valeria di Notte Zoo</strong>, our mission is to inspire, educate, and act ‚Äî to foster a deeper connection between humans and the natural world. We believe that zoos are not merely places of observation, but powerful platforms for conservation, research, and public engagement.
    </p>

    <h2>üåç Conservation First</h2>
    <p>
      We are deeply committed to the conservation of endangered species and habitats. Through carefully designed breeding programs, habitat restoration projects, and international partnerships, we strive to prevent extinction and restore ecological balance. Our zoo is a proud member of the <em>European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA)</em> and supports over a dozen global conservation initiatives.
    </p>

    <h2>üìö Education at the Core</h2>
    <p>
      Education is the cornerstone of change. Every exhibit, guided tour, and educational program at our zoo is designed to awaken curiosity, promote environmental literacy, and empower future generations. We welcome thousands of school groups annually and offer tailored workshops for all ages, from young children to university researchers.

    <h2>üß™ Science and Research</h2>
    <p>
      Our zoo partners with leading universities and institutions to conduct critical research in animal behavior, veterinary medicine, biodiversity, and climate change. These studies not only inform best practices within our own zoo but also contribute to scientific understanding and global conservation policy.
    </p>

    <h2>üíö Animal Welfare</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize the physical and emotional well-being of every animal in our care. Our enclosures are designed to mimic natural habitats, promote enrichment, and meet the highest welfare standards. A dedicated veterinary team ensures round-the-clock care, while behavioral enrichment specialists create stimulating environments that support natural behaviors.
    </p>

    <h2>ü§ù Community and Inclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Valeria di Notte Zoo is more than a wildlife park ‚Äî it‚Äôs a community institution. We actively collaborate with local schools, NGOs, artists, and civic organizations to bring the power of wildlife to the wider public. Accessibility and inclusion are central to our design and programming, ensuring everyone feels welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>üå± Toward a Sustainable Future</h2>
    <p>
      Sustainability guides everything we do ‚Äî from solar-powered buildings and composting systems to sustainable sourcing and zero-waste targets. We aim not only to minimize our footprint but also to lead by example in sustainable operations.
    </p>
