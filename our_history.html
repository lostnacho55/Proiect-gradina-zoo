    <p>
      The Valeria di Notte Zoo was founded in 1963 by a group of local conservationists and animal lovers
      who dreamed of creating a safe haven for rescued and endangered animals. What began as a modest sanctuary
      with just a handful of enclosures quickly grew in popularity thanks to its focus on ethical treatment
      and public education.

    <p>
      During the 1980s, the zoo underwent a major expansion, adding large-scale exhibits that replicated
      natural habitats. This transformation included the creation of a tropical rainforest dome, a savannah
      plain for large herbivores, and state-of-the-art enclosures for big cats and primates. These improvements
      were guided by a new mission: to inspire conservation through immersion and connection.

    <p>
      In the 2000s, Valeria di Notte Zoo became a leading institution in conservation research and international
      breeding programs. We partnered with organizations around the world to protect endangered species such as
      the Amur leopard, black rhinoceros, and Philippine eagle. Our on-site veterinary hospital and nursery
      became a hub for animal rehabilitation and care.

    <p>
      Today, the zoo spans over 80 acres and is home to more than 200 species. Our dedication to sustainability
      is reflected in our solar-powered infrastructure, rainwater systems, and wildlife-friendly landscaping.
      Each year, we welcome over 500,000 visitors who come not only to see animals, but to learn how to protect
      them for generations to come.
