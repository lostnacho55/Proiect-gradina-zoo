  <h1>Our History</h1>
  <p class="intro-text">
    For over six decades, <strong>Valeria di Notte Zoo</strong> has been a beacon of wildlife conservation, education, and wonder. 
    From humble beginnings as a grassroots sanctuary to its current status as a world-class zoological institution, 
    our story is one of passion, innovation, and an unshakable commitment to the natural world.

    <h2>1963: A Dream Takes Root</h2>
    <p>
      In 1963, a small group of visionary conservationists—led by biologist <strong>Dr. Elena Moretti</strong> and philanthropist <strong>Luca Bianchi</strong>—founded Valeria di Notte Zoo 
      on the outskirts of Timisoara. Their goal was simple but radical for the time: to create a sanctuary where rescued animals 
      could thrive, not just survive. The zoo opened with just 12 enclosures, housing injured local wildlife and a few exotic species 
      confiscated from illegal trade. From day one, education was central; schoolchildren were invited to learn about animal behavior 
      through hand-painted signs and guided talks—a novelty in postwar Europe.

    <h2>The 1980s: A Revolution in Zoo Design</h2>
    <p>
      The 1980s marked a turning point. Under director <strong>Dr. Sofia Reinhart</strong>, the zoo pioneered "immersion exhibits" that replaced 
      barred cages with sprawling, naturalistic habitats. The iconic <em>Tropical Rainforest Dome</em> (1987) became Europe’s first indoor 
      rainforest replica, complete with free-flying birds and a canopy walkway. The <em>African Savannah Plain</em> (1989) introduced 
      mixed-species grazing, allowing zebras, giraffes, and ostriches to roam together as they would in the wild. These innovations 
      earned Valeria di Notte Zoo recognition as a leader in ethical animal display.

    <h2>2000s: Science Takes Center Stage</h2>
    <p>
      The new millennium saw the zoo evolve into a global conservation hub. Our <strong>Center for Species Survival</strong> (2004) launched 
      breakthrough breeding programs for critically endangered species, including the world’s first successful artificial insemination 
      of Amur leopards. The on-site <em>Wildlife Hospital</em> (2008) became a lifeline for trafficked and injured animals, rehabilitating 
      over 300 individuals annually. Partnerships with the <em>IUCN</em> and <em>WWF</em> expanded our impact to habitats worldwide—from 
      protecting Sumatran tiger corridors to coral reef restoration projects.

    <h2>Today: A Legacy of Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Now spanning 80 acres, Valeria di Notte Zoo is a testament to what zoos can achieve. Our <em>Nocturnal Worlds Pavilion</em> (2020) 
      honors the zoo’s namesake ("Valeria of the Night") with moonlit habitats for bats, aye-ayes, and other elusive creatures. 
      Solar panels power 80% of operations, and our "Zero Waste by 2030" initiative has already diverted 92% of landfill waste. 
      Most importantly, we’ve touched millions of lives—through school programs, citizen science projects, and unforgettable encounters 
      that spark lifelong advocacy for wildlife.
